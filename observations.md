# Piece

Schubert Impromptu op 90 no 3. Quite simple structurally, with interesting expressiveness

For the analysis: there's many interpretations for this piece in the dataset. We don't think we should each look at all of them but that's definitely a richness we should benefit from. Maybe we can each look at a few interpretations. We should if possible, make observations (below) that apply to several pieces, and if we find such observations, we should definitely model them because it means they're really features of the piece and not only on the specific performer.

# Already in the midi

1. the main melodic voice is louder than the rest
2. explicit dynamic indications are followed (in a very simple way)

# Observations

3. slow down at the end
4. same rythmic irregularity during the accompaniment eightnotes: (common to several pieces)
   - bell shape for speed
   - bell shape for velocity
5. appogiatures come too late, and are louder than their resolution
6. goes faster during quarter note expressive phrases
7. slow down during arpeggated chords, trilles, stuff like that. it gives space for high expressiveness for these special features
8. massive slow down at the end of development, while transitioning back to the main theme (make it more general?) (common to several pieces)
9. some chords are arpegiatted
10. in general, when some resolution or appogiature happening, it is delayed in most performances. We could find a way to detect this, either by phrase analysis or chord analysis (harmonically detecting resolutions/cadences).

11. It seems that human performance is almost twice as fast as original one (it seems that bar 8 in original midi corresponds to bar 16 in performances, bar 19 to bar 33 and bar 39, see `Hou06M.mid`, `JeonH06.mid`).
12. Smooth velocity transitioning between bars with "volume marks" (p and pp, for example) (for example, check bar 20-21 transitioning in midi and 33-36 in `Hou06M.mid`, 39-42 in `JeonH06.mid`)
13. Check if there is correlation between duration of notes and velocity?

# OLD STUFF

what piece to analyze?

should be: - interesting - not to hard/complex

I would enjoy do an impressionist piece, such as
_ Debussy Pour le piano
_ Ravel pavane

the first one seems quite complex but the second one is fine.

Otherwise, some romantic piece:
_ chopin -> Polonaise or Barcarolle (quite expressive)
_ Schubert Impromptu op 90 no 3. Quite simple structurally, with interesting expressiveness (also I played the piece I while ago so I can help with interpretation questions)
