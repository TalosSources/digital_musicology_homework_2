what piece to analyze?

should be:
	- interesting
	- not to hard/complex

I would enjoy do an impressionist piece, such as 
	* Debussy Pour le piano
	* Ravel pavane

the first one seems quite complex but the second one is fine.

Otherwise, some romantic piece:
	* chopin -> Polonaise or Barcarolle (quite expressive)
	* Schubert Impromptu op 90 no 3. Quite simple structurally, with interesting expressiveness (also I played the piece I while ago so I can help with interpretation questions)
